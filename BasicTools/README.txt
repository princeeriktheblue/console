This folder is for the basic tools which I supply to anyone who is using the console. Currently this file will be expanding, and  in any case, all these commands are completely separate from the main console jar. These are loaded during runtime; and therefore in this is my dynamic command loading. In addition, sooner or later I am going to add an UPDATE function to my command list, allowing for runtime updating on commands.
