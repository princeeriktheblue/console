This is the main console executable jar file. This executable jar file (For you C++ people out there, this is the java variant of a .exe) is the main part of the entire project. This is where the main portion of the code is for functionality. 

Dependencies (For C++ people, DLLs): 
Engine.jar
ELib.jar

Currently speaking, I am trying to keep each different section of this program in separate jar files to make it a lot easier on my end.
