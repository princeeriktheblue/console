This is the core library jar which I use for each one of my projects. Inside of this jar is my own implementation of a dynamic vector. This implementation allows for static casting from Strings and is made to be more lightweight than the default ArrayList, without losing any functionality. It also holds closable and openable resources AFTER INSTANTIATION. Truthfully these classes use utilities to get the job done, however they allow for resources to be opened after, not during, instantiation; therefore removing the need to null check in catch or finally statements after the initial try statement fails. It also allows for dynamic resource changes without complete deconstruction of the reader/writer.
