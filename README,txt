This code is provided and made originally by me. I keep this code as up to date as I can, and I am currently in the process of 
organizing and documenting it better to increase efficiency.

Things I would like to do next:
- Dynamic Command loading (I need to figure out the exact specifications of the class loader and dynamic inheritance; it's been
      a pain for a while)
- Increased efficiency.
- More commands
- Internal scripting language
- Dedicated File extensions (Somewhat like a batch script)
- More OS tweeking and tools

 If anyone would like to help me with this, I would be grateful! I am doing this as a hobby, and I would like to make a great, free
 product out of this if I can!
