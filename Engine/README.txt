The Engine project is my own attempt at an internal scripting language. Though I do not have any formal education on how internal scripting languages work, or any scripting language for that matter, I will be taking the dive in and attempt to create one. This is the project for that language. This language, however, also holds some key components to the functionality of my Console project, which is why I have included the files here as well.

Dependencies:
ELib.jar
